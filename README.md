# Core-Computer-Components

Computer are made up of 10 components:
1. Central Processing Unit (CPU) – The brain of the computer that processes instructions.

2. Motherboard – The main circuit board that connects all components together.

3. Random Access Memory (RAM) – Temporary memory that stores data for active processes.

9. Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) / Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) – Low-level software that initializes hardware at boot.

So why is this important?:
- All these hardware are working together allowing a system to operate
- When a user uses an application it will use the resource from one or more of the hardware
- So any incident or cyber attack we can trace back to either one of these hardware
- Knowing the hardware/components will make troubleshooting easierl
